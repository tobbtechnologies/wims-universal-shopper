# Wims Universal Shopper(WUS)

This is a blockchain based dApp for collecting loyalty shopping points world wide. The primary goal of this project is to making shopping profitable for shoppers who are mainly women according to this research https://www.statista.com/statistics/311406/us-online-shopping-categories-gender/.

WIMS Universal Shopper is a consumer loyalty points dApp(blockchain - smart contract) which integrate all existing cards/apps/programs shoppers carry.

Why?

According to Lindsey Peacock(2008),"Over the last decade, loyalty and customer rewards programs have proven theyâ€™re an effective way to drive customer retention, boost customer lifetime value, and inspire loyalty. While the low-key punch card has its place for some businesses, a truly innovative approach to customer loyalty programs can create huge value for retailers."(Source: https://www.shopify.com/blog/loyalty-program)

The problem:

When people shop in stores they are given points via a vendor specific shopping cards. Each company has its own card to promote its product/services.

a) Too many cards to carry

The proliferation of these means of retaining/rewarding customers/members leads to making consumers carrying many cards/join many programs. With WIMS Universal Shopper, consumers will not need to do that, only their mobile numbers will earn them rewards across all their shopping experiences locally and internationally.

b) Loss of rewards

Quite often consumers lose cards and consequently lose points/rewards. Forgetting the cards(or losing these cards) at home also leads to loss of points/rewards. WUS will stop these problems and consequently more women will benefit from accrued rewards stored permanently on blockchain.

Consumers must be able to get their shopping rewards with or without a card using their mobile phone numbers as the only needed Identifier.

c) New Companies will find it easy to introduce their rewards.

New companies thinking of creating new cards/rewards for new services/products can save funds by just registering with wims-universal-shopper.

d) Remote Women

Quite often women leaving in remote areas lack access to these rewards. WUS must be usable in areas like farms, villages, rural areas where there is no internet access. 

The dApp should work offline and sync with the blockchain when the user is where there is wifi or internet connection.

e) Save data

Many women have limit access to data or fast internet. The dApp must run on 2G/3G and work offline as well to help women use it with limited data.

d) Security

The dApp should be secure, simple, efficient and blend naturally with women's experiences.

I am looking for funding for this WIMS dApp. I am also looking for interested developers to partner and make this happen. Lastly I am looking for companies interested in partnering with WIMS on this or other projects.
